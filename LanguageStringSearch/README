If you've ever had an issue where a string was being displayed on the screen but you couldn't figure out which language
file or language string was producing that text, this file will edit the language files adding the numeric value to the
end of any string in finds.  you that you're quick repair and refresh your screen and suddenly there's a numeric
value at the end of your text string.  you just do a search through the customer directory for that number and you'll
find your language.

So, if you were looking at "Line Items" on the screen, you would just edit this file to add "Line Items" as the search
term and also in the non-numeric part of the replace string, and then run the script from the root directory
of the instance.  After that run a quick repair and refresh your screen.

so the line in the file would be
$newContents = str_replace("'Line Items';", "'Line Items{$i}';", $file, $count);

you can erase the text replace term entirely and just leave the numeric part if you want like this

$newContents = str_replace("'Line Items';", "'{$i}';", $file, $count);

But, normally, when I use the tool I put the same thing for search & replace and leave the number at the end of the
replace.

one thing about the script is that it will put the same number for every instance of the search term in a
particular file. So if your search term appears 20 times in a single file all 20 of those will have the same
number appended to the end. This will least get you down to the file then once I have the file I manually replace the
numbers with letters A, B, C, etc. to you find the exact string.  remember to do the quick repair after you
replace the numbers letters.
